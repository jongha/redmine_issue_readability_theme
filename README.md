# Redmine Issue Readability Theme

## Installing a theme

1. First, copy the theme-directory into ../public/themes/. This would result in a directory-path to application.css like:

  ../public/themes/<themename>/stylesheets/application.css

2. You now may need to restart Redmine so that it shows the newly installed theme in the list of available themes.

2. Go to "Administration -> Settings" -> "Display" and select your newly created theme in the "Theme" drop-down list. Save your settings.

Redmine should now be displayed using the selected theme.
